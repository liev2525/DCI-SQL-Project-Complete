--Join Tables 
--Question 1: Identify which family members used which card 'ending-in' to pay for their item, using a JOIN.
select ShoePurchase.Family_ID, FamilyTable.First_name, FamilyTable.Last_name, PaymentTable.Card_Ending
from ShoePurchase
inner join FamilyTable on FamilyTable.Family_ID = ShoePurchase.Family_ID
inner join PaymentTable on PaymentTable.Card_Ending = ShoePurchase.Card_Ending
--Question 2: What is the average, minimum, and max amount spent on shoes for the family? Show using an aggregate function
SELECT AVG(Payment_Amount)as AVG_PAID, MIN (Payment_Amount) as MIN_PAID, MAX (Payment_Amount) as MAX_PAID
from ShoePurchase
where Payment_Amount is not null
--Question 3: Which family members chose which shoe that cost greater than > $30? Show using a subquery
select Shoe_Type
from (select Shoe_Type from ShoePurchase where Payment_Amount > 20)
--Ensure the same creditcard was not used more than once. Ensure no duplicates present
select distinct Card_Ending
from PaymentTable
where Card_Ending is not null
